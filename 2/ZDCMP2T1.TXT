Description             : ZDCMP2 Take 1 was meant to be the successor to the
			  ZDCMP1 but unfortunately was never finished due to 
			  the lack of interest and very bad planning. Being lost
			  years ago, this version got simply compiled for the
			  archives and people who are interested in some history.

Credits			: No idea who has been working on this, so let's just
			  thank those who remember some of their work in there
			  while playing.
